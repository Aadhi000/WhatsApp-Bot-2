## F.A.Q
Answer a few frequently asked questions;
### Can you read my messages?
This project is open source so all the codes are clear. Neither less nor more; you can look what you want. **We absolutely do not have access to your accounts.**

### What about our security?
If you are concerned about security, you can install it on your own computer. If you think someone else has captured your data, simply click on **Whatsapp> Three Dots> Whatsapp Web> Logout** from all sessions button.

### Is it paid?
**Of course not.** It will never happen. But you can donate to us. You can reach me via [Telegram](https://t.me/fusuf) .
